## Description
This is a time tracking app for me to keep up with web administration clients. I can log in, add to the tasks for individual accounts.

Clients can register and view their account seeing how much time their requests have taken and how much time they have left in their monthly package.



## Demo
TBA



## Details for teaching team
The idea for this would be a sub-domain or sub-folder on my website. So, I didn't feel the need to add a landing page.

Instead I take users straight to the login page. Once logged in, clients are redirected to the tasks list for their account and the admin user is taken to the client overview page.

The two required users are set up as clients and the admin login is admin@admin.com. All users have the same password, 'helloworld'.
