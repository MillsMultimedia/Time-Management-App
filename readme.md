# Time Managment App


### Description
This is a time tracking app for me to keep up with web administration clients. I can log in, add to the tasks for individual accounts.

Clients can register and view their account seeing how much time their requests have taken and how much time they have left in their monthly package.

I didn't feel the need to add a landing page since there is only one purpose for the app. Instead I take users straight to the login page. Once logged in, clients are redirected to the tasks list for their account and the admin user is taken to the client overview page.
